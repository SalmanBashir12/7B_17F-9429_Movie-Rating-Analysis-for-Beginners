## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

loading libraries
```{r}
install.packages('scales')
install.packages('gtrendsR')
install.packages('ggplot2')
install.packages('readr')
library(scales)
library(gtrendsR)
library(ggplot2)

```
#Loading dataset
```{r}
data_Movies <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\Hp\\Documents\\R\\7B_17F-9429_Movie-Rating-Analysis-for-Beginners\\movies.csv")
head(data_Movies)
data_Ratings <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\Hp\\Documents\\R\\7B_17F-9429_Movie-Rating-Analysis-for-Beginners\\ratings.csv")
head(data_Ratings)

```
selecting colums from movies

```{r}
data_Movies=na.omit(data_Movies)
data_Movies=na.omit(data_Ratings)
head(data_Ratings)
colnames(data_Movies) <-c("Id","Title","Genre") # changing the column names as suitable
head(data_Movies)
tail(data_Movies)
colnames(data_Ratings) <- c("User","Id","Ratings","Timestamp")
head(data_Ratings)
```
Now I am going to merge these two datasets into one, these two datasets have a common column as ID, which contains movie ID
```{r}
total <- merge(data_Movies,data_Ratings,by="Id")
total
```
As 10 is the highest rating a viewer can give, letâ€™s take a look at the top 10 movies that got 10 ratings by viewers:

```{r}

```

## Including Plots

```{r}

plots <-ggplot(data = data_Ratings,aes(x = Genre,y=Rating,color = Genre))
plots + geom_point() + geom_smooth(fill = NA) + ggtitle("Scatter plot for Genre  V/S  rating")+ 
  xlab("Critic Ratings")+
  ylab("Audience Ratings")+
  theme(axis.title.x = element_text(color="red",size = 35),
        axis.title.y = element_text(color="purple",size = 35),
        legend.title = element_text(color="purple",size = 15))
```
You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
